# Zombies vs He-Man
A Greenfoot game using Design Patterns in Java

This is a team project for my CmpE 202 course at SJSU. We have created an interactive Greenfoot game and implemented 4 design patterns. For developing this game we have divided our work in two sprints (as per Agile methodology). First sprint was dedicated to understanding the technologies involved and in the second sprint, we developed the complete game.

The design patterns implemented in this game are:
  1. Observer Pattern
  2. State Pattern
  3. Factory Pattern
  4. Strategy Pattern
